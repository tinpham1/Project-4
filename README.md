The first image, launch data, showcases the global mission data over the years. Data is spread from 1957 to 2022. The bar chart shows the total count of missions per year.  In green, it shows the number of successful missions, while in red, it shows the number of failed missions. Partial failure is in orange, and pre-launch failure is in yellow. When looking at the graph, you can see that the late 60’s to late 70’s had a spike, and the 2020s had the next spike. 


The second horizontal bar chart shows each company’s launch performance. It shows the total number of missions that were carried out by each company/country. Same as the previous graph, in green it shows the successful launches by each company/country, while red shows the number of failed missions. Orange shows the partial failures, and yellow shows the pre-launch failures. When looking at this graph, it clearly shows that Russia or the USSR is leading with a clear margin. 


The third graph focuses on rocket reliability. This graph shows all the rockets that have launched a mission. In green, you can see active rockets as of 2022, with the number of missions each rocket has launched. In orange, you can see the rockets that have been retired. Cosmos-3M is the rocket that has launched the most missions. However, Cosmos-3M is retired. Falcon 9 is the active rocket that has the highest number of missions. 

The final graph is based on the machine learning model that was used to predict the number of missions over the next 25 years. This line graph shows how the number of missions progresses over the years. The blue line shows the Yhat values. This is the predicted number. The upper yellow line shows the upper Yhat, and the lower yellow line shows the lower Yhat. For example, in 2050, the model predicted 394.5 missions. And showed a predicted upper Yhat of 470, and a lower Yhat of 316.1. 

The final link is for the dashboard that will showcase a combined image of all four visualizations.
